## Paper and dataset will be available soon.

This repo is a complementary of [our main project here](https://github.com/datduong/tobii-eye-track-syndromic-faces). 

This repo uses EfficientNetB4 to classify face images into 11 labels (healthy inviduals and 10 syndromic conditions).

More instructions (and possibly new classifiers) will be provided in the incoming weeks.
