Final paper will be available very soon [(first draft)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.26.23293119v1). 

All images were collected via online search; however, due to redistribution copyright issues, we cannot freely redistribute these images. Please contact us for the dataset.

This repo is a complementary of [our main project here](https://github.com/datduong/tobii-eye-track-syndromic-faces). This repo uses EfficientNetB4 to classify face images into 11 labels (healthy inviduals and 10 syndromic conditions).
